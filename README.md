# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection using ResNet-50 & PlantVillage Dataset

This project leverages deep learning and transfer learning with ResNet-50 to classify plant diseases using the PlantVillage dataset. The model helps in identifying whether a plant is healthy or suffering from a disease, aiding in early diagnosis and better crop management.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Dataset: PlantVillage (without augmentation) from ActiveLoop Hub
Model: ResNet-50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
Approach:
Load and preprocess dataset
Train a ResNet-50 model using transfer learning
Evaluate model performance
Visualize results using charts

# ðŸ—‚ Dataset Description
The dataset contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plants. Each image is categorized into:

Healthy
Diseased (various plant diseases like leaf spot, rust, mildew, etc.)
