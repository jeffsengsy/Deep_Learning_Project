# :seedling: Problem 
This project aims to automate the detection of plant health utilizing computer vision. - The application will dectect the plants health based on quality of leaves, height, and color.
This will help with 


# :potted_plant: Smart Agriculture 
Dataset: Satellite or drone images of crops
Goal: Use computer vision to monitor plant health

# :maple_leaf: Dataset
https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_leaves
4502 images of 4502 images of healthy and unhealthy plant leaves
- Will expand dataset once model has been created and trained

# :fallen_leaf: Execution
- Data Processing
- Image Augmentation
- Models: CNN, VGG
- Hyperparameter Tuning
